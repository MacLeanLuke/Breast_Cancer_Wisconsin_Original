# Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin_Original
A variety of machine learning methods applied on the UCI Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set. The data set has been included in the csv file. The methods were built with Python in the Google Colab IDE. 
Simply open the files in Google colab along with the dataset and run the application. In an effort to minimize runtime on each of the methods, visualizations have been excluded.

```
import { CSVLink, CSVDownload } from "react-csv";

const csvData = [
  ["firstname", "lastname", "email"],
  ["Ahmed", "Tomi", "ah@smthing.co.com"],
  ["Raed", "Labes", "rl@smthing.co.com"],
  ["Yezzi", "Min l3b", "ymin@cocococo.com"]
];
<CSVLink data={csvData}>Download me</CSVLink>;
